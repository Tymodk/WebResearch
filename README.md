# My AI Web Research
I've been tasked to learn something all on my own, so here's that!

Within the Logbook you will find my learning process, where I add my step-by-step process. Whenever I find something that I find interesting I add it to the Logbook and add some explanation about what I've found in the link and what I've learned from it. 

Within the Demo folder you will find the demos I've either found or made myself to learn more about Artificial Intelligence through actual usage of coding and examples. Due to the incredible complexity of Artificial Intelligence I am a bit skeptical about whether or not I'll be able to find, or make, a lot of coding examples.
