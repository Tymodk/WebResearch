# My Logbook

My first thought was to get a proper idea about what AI entails. So these are the links I got the most out of: 
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/190/artificial-intelligence-ai
https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-101-how-to-get-started/

This gave me a much needed insight on the types of Artificial Intelligence there are. Or atleast how they learn. I will most likely use the info of this website to do the introduction about the presentation I'm going to make about the topic as it seems to be the best entry into AI. 

Next up I wanted to atleast have some form of code to see how an AI could be made. So I started searching for the easiest AI possible and stumbled upon the following link about making a neural network with a very small amount of code. I've explained the code in the demo section of this research GIT.
